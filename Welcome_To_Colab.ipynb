        "Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming\n",
        "\n",
        "-->Python is a popular programming language due to its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Its easy-to-understand syntax makes it accessible to beginners, while being an interpreted language allows developers to execute code line by line, simplifying the debugging process. Python is cross-platform, meaning it runs seamlessly on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. It also boasts an extensive collection of libraries for web development, data science, machine learning, and more. Python is dynamically typed, meaning variables do not require explicit declarations of data types, and it supports object-oriented programming, offering features like classes and inheritance. A large, active community ensures strong support and a wealth of resources, while Pythonâ€™s ability to integrate with other languages and platforms enhances its flexibility. Its portability allows code to be written once and executed across different environments.\n",
